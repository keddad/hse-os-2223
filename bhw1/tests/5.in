 fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.  The new process is referred to as the child process.  The calling process is referred to as the parent process.

       The  child process and the parent process run in separate memory spaces.  At the time of fork() both memory spaces have the same content.  Memory writes, file mappings (mmap(2)), and
       unmappings (munmap(2)) performed by one of the processes do not affect the other.
